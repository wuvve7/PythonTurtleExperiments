# Turtle Graphics Projects

This repository contains my experiments using the **Turtle** library in Python. These projects demonstrate different ways to use Turtle for interactive graphical programming. Below are two key projects that Iâ€™ve worked on:

## Projects:

### 1. Turtle Race Game
A fun race game where **4 turtles** race towards the finish line. The turtles move randomly and the first one to cross the finish line wins!

#### Key Features:
- **Four turtles** race to the finish line.
- The turtles move **randomly** with different speeds.
- The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
- A simple and fun way to learn **loops** and **randomness** in programming.

#### How It Works:
- Each turtle moves forward by a random number of steps in every iteration.
- The game continues until one of the turtles crosses the finish line.
- The winning turtle's color is printed in the console.
 ### 2. Colorful Half Circles using Turtle Graphics
This project uses Python's **Turtle** library to draw a series of **7 colorful half circles** arranged in a sequence. Each half circle is progressively larger than the previous one, and each is filled with a different color from the **rainbow**.
#### Key Features:
- Draws **7 half circles** of increasing size.
- Each half circle is filled with a different **rainbow color**.
- Uses **Turtle graphics** to create an interactive, visually attractive design.
- Demonstrates the power of **loops** and **basic Turtle commands** for creating dynamic graphics.

#### How It Works:
1. The project uses a loop to draw **7 half circles**.
2. Each half circle is drawn **larger** than the previous one.
3. After drawing each half circle, the turtle moves to a new position to ensure the circles do not overlap.
4. Each half circle is filled with a different **rainbow color**, creating a beautiful gradient effect.
